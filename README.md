## Elevate your life with Enliven

Enliven is the ultimate tool designed to help you build healthy habits, manage emotions, and improve sleep quality. With personalized plans and activities tailored to your individual needs and lifestyle, Enliven empowers you to take control of your life. Our learning section provides resources on recognizing and changing unhealthy habits, managing stress, staying motivated, and taking proactive steps to enhance your overall well-being.

### Habits

Have you ever wanted to change your habits but didn't know where to start? With Enliven, that uncertainty is a thing of the past. Our "Habits" segment allows you to create your daily routine effortlessly. Whether you choose from our suggested habits or create your own To-Do List, developing healthy habits becomes straightforward and manageable.

Habits play a crucial role in helping you achieve your goals, increase productivity, and lead a healthier lifestyle. They can improve relationships, enhance organization, and provide valuable learning experiences from past mistakes. By building discipline and resilience, habits contribute to a general sense of achievement. In this segment, you can also access your profile overview, track your XP and streaks, and view the leaderboard to see your rank compared to other users, offering additional motivation to stay on track.

### Mood

Have you ever felt down and unsure of what to do when you're feeling down? The "Mood" section is here to help you feel better. Start by accessing motivational quotes and tips designed to uplift your spirits. The Emotion Book serves as a confidant where you can express your feelings openly. If you feel lonely and need someone to talk to, Enliven Social provides a platform to communicate with other users, either anonymously or publicly, with your the emotion you are currently experiencing shared or hidden.

Sharing emotions is vital as it helps you process them, build trust and understanding with others, and gain perspective during difficult times. It fosters stronger connections with those you share with and prevents emotional suppression, which can lead to physical and mental health issues. By sharing, you become more aware of your emotions and their impact on your behavior, ultimately promoting emotional well-being.

### Sleep

Struggling with insomnia and can't find a solution? The "Sleep" segment offers various options to improve your sleep quality. Begin by selecting your desired bedtime and following a recommended sleep plan. Good sleep is essential for overall health and well-being, as poor sleep can lead to numerous physical and mental health issues, such as fatigue, poor concentration, decreased motivation, and increased risks of obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. Adequate sleep is also crucial for reducing stress levels.

To enhance your sleep experience, we offer relaxing sounds available 24/7. You can choose from a variety of sounds or create your own custom soundscapes. Additionally, our "Meditation" section provides several guided meditations with detailed steps, including various guided and animated breathing exercises designed to promote relaxation and improve sleep quality.

# Functionality Description:

Enliven welcomes new users with a brief introduction and guides them through the initial setup. Users are prompted to enter their name, bedtime, and select a sleep plan (6-hour, 7-hour, or 8-hour). Once the setup is complete, users access the "Main Activity," featuring a navigation menu that allows seamless switching between three primary fragments: "Habits" (Home), "Mood" (Dashboard), and "Sleep" (Notifications).

## Habits:

### Overview
The "Habits" fragment starts with a personalized greeting message, "What are you doing?" followed by the user's name. Below the greeting, users find a section dedicated to habits, where they can choose from predefined habits or create a custom To-Do list.

### Selecting Habits
Users can choose from several categories of habits, each containing multiple tasks. After selecting a desired task, users can set a goal (e.g., the number of pages of a book to read). Clicking the "Add" button confirms the addition of the habit, and a success message confirms it has been added to their list. The selected tasks appear on the user's habit list, and as they progress towards their goal, the remaining count decreases. Upon completing the goal, users receive a congratulatory message: "Congratulations! You have successfully completed the task."

### Custom To-Do List
Users can create custom tasks in the To-Do list, with options to edit or delete them. Once a custom task is completed, users can check it off as successfully finished.

### Lessons and Tracking Progress
The "Habits" segment also includes short lessons on habits that require just a few minutes of the user's day. In the "My Profile" section, users can track their XP and streaks. Completing sound sessions, habits, breathing exercises, or recording feelings increases the user's XP, while streaks accumulate with each consecutive day of app use.

## Mood

### Overview
Upon entering the "Mood" fragment, users are greeted with a personalized message, "How are you?" alongside their name. This section is dedicated to enhancing emotional well-being through interactive and supportive features.

### Quotes and Stories
The fragment features 20 stories, each containing motivational quotes. Unread quotes are marked with a question mark icon within the story circle, while read quotes are indicated with a checkmark. Read quotes are automatically moved to the end of the horizontal list to prioritize unread content. Each story is presented for 5 seconds and offers interactive controls: users can pause by holding, skip by swiping right, or exit by swiping down.

### Enliven Social
For first-time users, Enliven Social begins with an introductory prompt. Users are prompted to enter their phone number, and upon completion, a verification code is sent to authenticate their number. Following this, users select a username and log into their profile.

Enliven Social facilitates communication through a chat function where users can exchange messages, images, react to messages, reply within threads, and view message history. The profile picture is dynamically updated to reflect the user's last chosen emotion from the Emotion Book.

### Profile and Leaderboard
Users can view their profile overview, including their ranking on the leaderboard for both streaks and XP compared to other users. Optionally, users can choose to remain anonymous, with their profile and ranking displayed as "anonymous" instead of their username.

### Tips and Emotion Guide
Adjacent to Enliven Social, users can access mood tips, offering practical suggestions to improve mood. The "Emotion Guide" section underscores the benefits of emotional expression, highlighting Enliven Social and the Emotion Book as primary tools for sharing feelings.

### Emotion Book
The Emotion Book serves as a confidential platform for users to express and manage their emotions at any time. Upon accessing the Emotion Book, users select an emotion category, followed by tips to enhance emotional well-being. Users can record their emotions in the main section of the Emotion Book, with each entry accompanied by an emoji reflecting the selected emotion. Entries can be edited by clicking on them or deleted by holding the entry.

### Emotion History
To provide continuity, the "Mood" fragment concludes with a card displaying the last five emotions recorded in the Emotion Book, allowing users to reflect on recent emotional experiences.

## Sleep

### Overview
The "Sleep" fragment adapts its greeting message based on the time of day: "Good night" appears at bedtime, while "Hello" greets users during waking hours. The fragment focuses on optimizing sleep quality through tailored features and functionalities.

### Bedtime Management
The selected bedtime and calculated wake-up time are prominently displayed on a card, along with a countdown indicating time remaining until the next sleep or wake period. Users can adjust their bedtime preferences by clicking the "Change" button.

### Ambient Sounds
Users can access ambient sounds categorized into nature, music, ambient, rain, and space themes. Each category offers themed sounds aimed at promoting relaxation and aiding sleep quality. Upon selecting a sound, users can adjust volume settings, set timers, and add sounds to their favorites list. The activity background dynamically changes to match the selected sound theme, enhancing user immersion.

### Meditations and Breathing Exercises
The fragment introduces the benefits of meditation through an informative dialog, emphasizing its role in promoting relaxation and improving sleep quality. Users can choose from a variety of recommended meditations and breathing exercises, each explained in detail to facilitate relaxation and mental clarity. The section offers guided breathing exercises designed for specific purposes such as focus, sleep enhancement, relaxation, and balance. Each exercise includes session duration, repetition count, and detailed inhalation and exhalation guidance to optimize effectiveness.

# Code description:

## General

The project was developed in the **Android Studio** environment, mainly using **Java** on the client side. Certain parts of the code were written in **Kotlin** for both practice and clarity.

## Structure

The code is structure in two main Android Studio packages:

* **```com.example.enliven.ui```** - for all UI logic and elements. For easier navigation, it is split up in subdirectories such as ```com.example.enliven.ui.auth```, ```com.example.enliven.ui.base```, ```com.example.enliven.ui.chat```, ```com.example.enliven.ui.dashboard```, ```com.example.enliven.ui.emotions```, ```com.example.enliven.ui.habits```, etc.

* **```com.example.enliven.data```** - API class for client-server communication.

## Libraries

In the application ```build.gradle``` file there is a complete list of dependencies which the project uses. 

Some of the more important ones are:

* **Google Firebase** - for user authentification and phone number verification. Offers a simple API for communication with the Google Firebase console.

* **StreamSDK** - development kit for the chat function of the application. Enables a faster and simpler configuration of the chat features, channel list, and database querying.

* **Airbnb Lottie** - library for modern and more complex animations, as well as custom ones.

* **Utility Libraries** - **Retrofit** (for server queries), **Picasso** (miscellaneous functions for ImageView manipulation), **Gif Drawable** (enables the use of gifs), **Palette** (generates a custom color palette, used for dynamic backgrounds), **AnyChart** (graphs for showing statistics), etc.
 
 ## Tech Stack
 
 **Client:** Android Studio Java + dependencies
 
 [**Auth Token Provider:**](https://github.com/EdinHass/EnlivenServer) NodeJS, Express
